# May 2023 News

- We added a [tutorial ](https://cardinal.cels.anl.gov/tutorials/nekrs_stochastic.html) for performing forward [!ac](UQ) simulations using NekRS and the MOOSE stochastic tools module
- We have updated the NekRS version used in Cardinal. This requires all users of the NekRS wrapping
  to make some changes to their input files (the update was not backwards compatible). Please
  check the [NekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS) release notes to learn more.
